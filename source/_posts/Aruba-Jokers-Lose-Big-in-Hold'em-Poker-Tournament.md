#  Aruba Jokers Lose Big in Hold'em Poker Tournament

While the Aruba Jokers had high hopes for winning the poker tournament on the cruise ship, they ultimately lost big.

The team of six players, including casino owner Larry Litton and his son, Lance, was among the final nine players vying for the $200,000 top prize in the no-limit Texas hold'em event.

But after a long day of play, the Aruba Jokers were out of contention. Lance ended up finishing in sixth place, earning $33,000. His father didn't fare much better, taking home $8,000 for finishing in ninth place.

The winner of the tournament was 34-year-old German player Fabian Quoss. He bested Canadian pro Jonathan Duhamel heads-up to take home the $200,000 first prize.

#  Why Is 7 2 the Worst Hand in Holdem Poker?

It's no secret that the "worst hand in poker" is two-pair, 7s and 2s. But why is this the worst possible hand?

There are a few reasons why this particular hand is so bad. For starters, it's unlikely that you'll make a full house or quads with two-pair. Additionally, there are many hands that can easily beat your two-pair, including hands like three of a kind, a straight, or a flush.

Furthermore, even if you do manage to make a full house or quads, your opponents will still have plenty of chances to beat you. For example, if someone has a set (three of a kind), they will automatically win the hand regardless of what you have.

In general, then, it's important to remember that two-pair is not a very strong hand in Holdem poker. If you're holding this hand, it's best to fold early in order to preserve your chip stack.

#  Aruba Poker Players Dread Getting dealt 7 2

The 7 2 offsuit is considered one of the worst possible hands in poker, and Aruba poker players dread getting dealt this hand.

With only two high cards and three low cards, the 7 2 is very likely to lose to almost any other hand. In fact, most online poker sites rank it as the worst possible starting hand in Texas hold'em.

That's why players usually fold this hand as soon as they see it. There's simply not enough potential for a winning hand to make it worth staying in the game.

Even though the odds are against them, some players do choose to bet or raise with the 7 2 in the hopes of catching a miracle card. But this is generally seen as a risky move that can quickly lead to a costly loss.

In general, it's best to just steer clear of the 7 2 when playing poker in Aruba.

#  Aruba Poker Pros Disappointed with Second-worst Hand

The World Poker Tour (WPT) Caribbean Poker Adventure has been anything but thrilling for the professionals representing Aruba.

Coming into the final table, a number of them were considered contenders for the championship, but they have all since been eliminated.

The disappointing showing is especially surprising because of the stellar performance of some of the online qualifiers. Calvin Anderson, who only qualified for the event online, came in second place and took home nearly $600,000.

Most notably, however, was Roberto Romanello’s elimination in 7th place. He is one of Aruba’s most successful poker players and has over $2 million in career earnings.

Romanello was unlucky enough to get dealt two pair – queens and tens – which was only good enough for 2nd from last place at the final table. This hand contributed to his elimination and cost him a chance at winning the title and prize money.

It is still too early to tell whether this was simply a bad run or if Aruba’s representatives are no longer as competitive on the international stage. In any case, it will be interesting to see how they perform in upcoming events.

#  Why Would Anyone Ever Play 7 2 in Holdem Poker?

Playing 7 2 offsuit in Texas holdem can be a profitable play under the right circumstances.

When making this play, you are hoping to hit one of your two remaining hearts on the flop in order to make a flush. If the flop comes with two hearts, you will have the best hand and can expect to win a lot of money.

Even if you don't hit a heart on the flop, you may still be able to make a straight or a flush depending on the other cards that come out. In general, it's worth risking a small amount of money to see this type of flop.

There are two main factors that you need to consider when deciding whether or not to play 7 2 offsuit: your position at the table and the size of the pot.

In general, you should only play 7 2 offsuit if you are in late position and the pot is small. This is because it's important to have as many options as possible when playing this hand. If there are several players yet to act after you, it's less likely that someone will have a heart and they will probably fold if they do.

However, if the pot is large or there are few players left to act, then it's usually worth playing 7 2 even if you're not in late position. This is because the likelihood of hitting your flush increases as more cards are revealed, and you may be able to take down the entire pot if someone else misses their draw.
