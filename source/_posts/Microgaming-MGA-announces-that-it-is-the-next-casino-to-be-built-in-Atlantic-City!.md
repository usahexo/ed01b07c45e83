#  Microgaming MGA announces that it is the next casino to be built in Atlantic City!

On Tuesday, Microgaming MGA announced that it would be building the next casino in Atlantic City. This will be the company’s first venture into the United States gambling market.

The $450 million project is set to begin construction in early 2020 and is scheduled to open by the end of 2022. The new casino will be located on the site of the former Sands Casino Hotel, which closed in 2011.

Microgaming MGA CEO, Seb Cousteau, said of the news:

“We are very excited to be making our entry into the US market with this world-class project in Atlantic City. This marks an important milestone for Microgaming as we seek to expand our global footprint and better serve our customers.”

According to reports, the new casino will feature 2,500 slot machines and 125 table games. It will also include a hotel with 500 rooms, restaurants, and a spa.

Atlantic City was once one of the most popular gambling destinations in the United States, but its casinos have been struggling in recent years due to competition from neighboring states. In 2017, five of its twelve casinos closed down.

Microgaming MGA is hoping that its new casino will help revive Atlantic City’s gambling industry. Cousteau said:

“This project is not only great for Microgaming but also for Atlantic City and the surrounding region as it will create jobs and bring much-needed economic development to the area. We believe that our experienced team and world-class product offering will make this property a success and look forward to welcoming players from all over the globe when it opens its doors in 2022.”

#  Is this the next big thing for Atlantic City?

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City is scheduled to open on June 28, and it is sure to be a game changer. This will be the first hotel and casino in Atlantic City that is owned by the Hard Rock brand.

The new hotel will have 470 rooms, including 17 suites. There will also be a 35,000 square foot casino, a 2,500 seat concert hall, and several restaurants. The hotel is expected to create 1,000 jobs.

This is great news for Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years. The city has lost thousands of jobs due to the closure of casinos and other businesses. The opening of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is likely to help turn things around for Atlantic City.

Visitors are already starting to take notice. In February, there was a 20% increase in room bookings compared to the same month the year before. This shows that there is genuine interest in this new property and that it will be successful.

There are already plans for expansion. The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino has said that it wants to add a second tower with 400 rooms within the next few years. This would make it one of the largest hotels in Atlantic City.

Atlantic City is definitely on the rebound and the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is leading the charge. This new property is sure to be a big hit with visitors and will help revive the city’s economy.

#  What's next for Atlantic City?

Atlantic City was once a thriving resort town, drawing visitors from around the country to its world-famous boardwalk and casinos. However, in recent years the city has faced economic hard times, with employment and revenue falling as neighboring states opened their own casinos.

Now Atlantic City is looking for a new strategy to revive its fortunes. Some proposals include developing the waterfront area, expanding tourism by targeting new markets, and legalizing gambling in other parts of the state.

However, these plans face significant challenges. The waterfront area is currently in disrepair, and it may be difficult to compete with well-established casino resorts in neighboring states. There is also opposition from some legislators who are wary of expanding gambling beyond Atlantic City.

Nonetheless, city officials remain hopeful that they can turn things around and revive Atlantic City's fortunes.
