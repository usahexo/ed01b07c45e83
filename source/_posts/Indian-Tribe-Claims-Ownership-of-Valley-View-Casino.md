#  Indian Tribe Claims Ownership of Valley View Casino

The Pauma Band of Luiseno Indians has filed a claim for the ownership of Valley View Casino, located in San Diego County, California. The tribe asserts that it is the rightful owner of the casino because the land on which it is located was once part of their ancestral territory.

The dispute over the casino's ownership began in October of last year, when the tribe filed a lawsuit against the casino's current owners, the United Auburn Indian Community. In their lawsuit, the Pauma Band of Luiseno Indians claimed that they had been unfairly denied ownership of the casino even though they were the first to submit a bid for its purchase.

The United Auburn Indian Community has responded to the tribe's lawsuit by denying any wrongdoing and asserting that they were within their rights to sell the casino to another party. The tribe has also alleged that the United Auburn Indian Community misled them about the sale process and failed to disclose important information about the casino's ownership.

A hearing on the Pauma Band of Luiseno Indians' claim for ownership of Valley View Casino is scheduled for later this month. If successful, the tribe would become responsible for its operations and would be required to pay taxes on its income.

#  Real Time Gaming

In the online casino world, there are two main types of gaming software providers: live dealers and RNGs (random number generators). The vast majority of casinos use RNG software, which provides games that are played on a personal computer or mobile device. Live dealer casinos are those that offer games with real dealers, who are broadcasting from a studio.

Real Time Gaming (RTG) is one of the few providers of live dealer casino software. The company was founded in 1998 and has been providing top-quality software to the online gambling industry ever since. RTG is based in Atlanta, Georgia, and is licensed in Curacao.

The company offers a wide range of games, including blackjack, roulette, baccarat, craps, and poker. In addition to the classic table games, RTG also offers a variety of slot games. These include both traditional three-reel slots and more modern video slots. There are also several progressive jackpot games available.

One of the best things about RTG software is that it is available in both download and instant play versions. This means that players can enjoy the games without having to download any software to their computer or mobile device. The instant play version also supports Mac users.

In addition to its award-winning software, RTG also offers excellent customer service. The company has a team of experienced and knowledgeable customer service representatives who are available 24/7 to help players with any questions or problems they may have.

If you’re looking for a trusted provider of live dealer casino software, then RTG is definitely a good option to consider. The company has been providing high-quality software for nearly two decades, and its customer service department is second to none.

# 2. Delaware North Companies Emerges as Preferred Owner of Valley View Casino & Real Time Gaming

Delaware North Companies, a gaming and hospitality company, has emerged as the preferred owner of Valley View Casino & Real Time Gaming. The agreement is subject to due diligence by both parties and regulatory approvals.

The proposed transaction includes the casino and racetrack in Valley Center, California, along with Real Time Gaming’s slot machine content and operations. It is anticipated that the acquisition will close in the first quarter of 2019.

“This is an excellent opportunity to expand our global gaming platform with an experienced operator that shares our commitment to delivering a best-in-class guest experience,” said Rickard Schneller, CEO of Delaware North Companies Gaming & Hospitality.

Valley View Casino employs approximately 1,000 people and features more than 2,500 slot machines and 79 table games. The casino’s racetrack offers live harness racing and simulcast wagering.

Real Time Gaming’s slot machine content is licensed to casinos in more than 15 countries across North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. The company also provides operational support services to its licensees, including marketing, technical support and game monitoring.

# 3. Caesars Entertainment Corporation Drops Out of the Running for Valley View Casino & Real Time Gaming

Las Vegas casino giant Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced today that it is withdrawing its bid for the Valley View Casino & Resort in San Diego. The company's decision leaves just two contenders in the running for the complex: the Los Angeles-based Pachanga Native American tribe and San Diego's Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation.

A Caesars spokesperson said that the company decided to pull out after it became clear that Pachanga was unwilling to negotiate in good faith. "We remain interested in pursuing a partnership with the tribe, but only if it is willing to engage in a substantive and meaningful dialogue about our proposal," said the spokesperson.

The Valley View Casino & Resort has been vacant since it was shut down by state regulators in early 2017. The closure was part of a broader crackdown on illegal gambling in California, which has resulted in dozens of casinos being shut down.

# 4. Gambling Company Pushes Back Against Proposed Sale of Valley View Casino to Real Time Gaming

The proposal by the California Gaming Commission to sell Valley View Casino to Real Time Gaming (RTG) has been met with opposition by the gambling company.

According to a statement released by the company, the proposed sale is "an ill-advised and premature proposal that threatens over 1,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic output."

The sale is said to be motivated by political considerations rather than what is best for the casino and its employees. RTG is a foreign-owned company and the fear is that it will lack the commitment needed to maintain and grow the casino's operations.

VALLEY VIEW CASINO EMPLOYEES 'HIGHJACK' COMMISSION MEETING TO PROTEST SALE PROPOSAL

In addition, Valley View Casino employs more than 1,000 people, most of whom are local residents. The sale would result in job losses and would have a significant negative impact on the local economy.

The proposed sale will be considered by the commission at a meeting later this month. Valley View Casino is urging its employees and members of the community to attend the meeting and voice their opposition to the proposed sale.

# 5. San Diego's Valley View Casino Could be Sold to Gambling Company in Las Vegas

# San Diego's Valley View Casino is in the market for a new buyer, as the Gambling Company in Las Vegas has put in a bid for the casino. The offer is said to be around $360 million, which would be a nice payday for the current owner, the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation.

# The casino has been under ownership of the tribe since it opened in 1994, and it has been a success ever since. The casino sees more than 5 million visitors each year, and it employs more than 1,200 people.

# While there is no guarantee that a sale will go through, if it does, it will be another feather in the cap of the gambling industry in Las Vegas. The company already owns several casinos in Nevada, and this would give them a foothold in Southern California as well.

# Some San Diegans are concerned that a sale could mean less money being funneled back into the local community. The Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation has been very active in supporting local charities and organizations over the years. It remains to be seen whether the new owners would continue this tradition.
