# Why is the Slot Machine Called a Puggy?

The slot machine is one of the most popular forms of gambling, found in casinos all over the world. It is a game of chance, where players place bets on the outcome of a spin of the reels. But have you ever heard of a slot machine being called a puggy? In this article, we’ll explore the origins of this term and how it came to be associated with slot machines.

## Origins of the Term “Puggy”

The term “puggy” is believed to have originated in Scotland, where it was used to refer to a type of mechanical game that was popular in the early 20th century. These games were often found in pubs and other social gathering places, and were played for small stakes.

The name “puggy” is thought to come from the Scottish word “puggie,” which means “monkey.” This may be because the machines often had colorful designs or symbols that resembled monkeys, or because the game itself required a certain level of dexterity, like that of a monkey.

## Puggy and Slot Machines

Over time, the term “puggy” came to be used more broadly to refer to any type of mechanical game, including slot machines. This usage is still common in Scotland and some other parts of the world, particularly in the United Kingdom.

It is unclear exactly when the term “puggy” began to be applied to slot machines, but it likely happened sometime in the mid-20th century. At that time, slot machines were becoming more common in pubs and other social gathering places, particularly in the UK. As a result, people began to refer to these machines as “puggies,” in reference to the earlier mechanical games that had been popular in those same venues.

## Conclusion

The term “puggy” may not be widely known outside of Scotland and the UK, but it is still used today to refer to slot machines and other types of mechanical games. The origins of the term are unclear, but it likely came from the Scottish word “puggie,” which means “monkey.” As slot machines became more popular in the mid-20th century, the term “puggy” began to be used to refer to these machines as well. Whether you call it a slot machine, a puggy, or something else entirely, there’s no denying the excitement and thrill of playing these games of chance.
