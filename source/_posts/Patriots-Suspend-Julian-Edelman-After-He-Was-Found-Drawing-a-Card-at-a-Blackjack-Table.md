#  Patriots Suspend Julian Edelman After He Was Found Drawing a Card at a Blackjack Table

The New England Patriots announced on Wednesday that they have suspended wide receiver Julian Edelman for the first four games of the season after he was found drawing a card at a blackjack table in Las Vegas.

“We are extremely disappointed that Julian chose to violate our policy and commit such a foolish act,” said Patriots owner Robert Kraft in a statement. “He has apologized to our organization and his teammates, and we accept his apology. We will suspend him for the first four games of the season and announce any further disciplinary action at a later date.”

Edelman, who is coming off of a Super Bowl MVP performance, will miss the Patriots’ season opener against the Houston Texans, as well as matchups against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Detroit Lions, and Miami Dolphins.

This isn’t the first time that Edelman has been disciplined by the Patriots. He was also suspended for four games back in 2016 for violating the NFL’s policy on performance-enhancing substances.

#  Tom Brady Shocked After Hearing Julian Edelman's Suspension

Tom Brady was visibly shaken yesterday after hearing the news that his close friend and Patriots teammate, Julian Edelman, had been suspended for four games for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing drug policy.

"This just came out of nowhere," said Brady. "I can't believe it. I don't know what to say."

Edelman, who led the Patriots in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdown receptions last season, issued a statement admitting that he had taken a banned substance.

"I don't know what I was thinking," said Edelman. "I'm sorry to my teammates and fans. I'll be ready to come back and contribute when I return in Week 5."

The Patriots are scheduled to open the season on Thursday night against the Kansas City Chiefs, and it is not yet clear who will replace Edelman in the starting lineup.

#  Could This Spell the End for the Patriots Dynasty?

The New England Patriots have been one of the most dominant teams in the NFL over the past two decades. They have won five Super Bowls and appeared in eight, but there are signs that this might all be coming to an end.

The Patriots were beaten by the Philadelphia Eagles in last year’s Super Bowl and they have started this season with a 2-2 record. There are already rumors that head coach Bill Belichick might be on the verge of stepping down and quarterback Tom Brady might be heading for retirement.

If this is the end for the Patriots dynasty, it has been a remarkable run. They have had more success than any other team in NFL history and they are still going strong, even if their dominance might be coming to an end.

#  Patriots Roster Shakes Up After Julian Edelman is Found Drawing a Card at a Casino

The New England Patriots are in the middle of their offseason and they just had a bit of a shake up. Wide Receiver Julian Edelman was found drawing a card at a casino and has been banned from casinos for one year. This means that he will not be able to compete in the upcoming season.

This is a significant loss for the Patriots as Edelman is one of their top players. He had 98 receptions for 1,106 yards and six touchdowns last season. He is also one of the team's leaders and is very popular with the fans.

Edelman's suspension will likely impact the team's chances of winning the Super Bowl this year. However, they still have a strong roster and there are several players who can step up and fill his role. Some of these players include Chris Hogan, Phillip Dorsett, and Cordarrelle Patterson.

The Patriots are still considered one of the top teams in the NFL and they should be able to compete without Edelman. They have already started training camp and are preparing for the upcoming season.

#  Pats Draw Line in the Sand With WRs After Julian Edelman Suspension

The New England Patriots have a message for the rest of the NFL: they will not be tanking this season. After the news of Julian Edelman's suspension, there were reports that the team might give up on the year and focus on rebuilding for 2019. But during a press conference on Thursday, head coach Bill Belichick made it clear that is not going to happen.

"I think we're doing the best we can to win games with the players that we have," Belichick said. "We're going to compete and try to win."

The implication was clear: any players who are not on board with that plan need to leave. And it appears that message has been sent to wide receivers Danny Amendola and Chris Hogan.

Both players are in the final year of their contracts, and there have been no indications that they will be re-signed. It now seems likely that they will both be released before the start of the season.

That would leave the Patriots with just three wide receivers on their roster: Brandin Cooks, Phillip Dorsett, and Cordarrelle Patterson. Cooks is one of the most explosive players in the league, while Dorsett provides speed and depth. Patterson is more of a niche player who can be used in a variety of ways, but he is not a true No. 1 receiver.

So it seems clear that New England is prepared to go into this season with limited weapons at wide receiver. But they are confident that they can still win games with Tom Brady under center.
