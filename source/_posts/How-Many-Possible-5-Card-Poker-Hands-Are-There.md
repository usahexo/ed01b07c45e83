#  How Many 5-Card Poker Hands Are There?

There are a total of 2,598,960 5-card poker hands.

To calculate the number of 5-card poker hands, we need to know how many possible hands there are and how many cards are in a deck. The number of possible hands is 52! or 4,320,000. The number of cards in a deck is 52. So, the number of 5-card poker hands is 4,320,000 / 52 = 2,598,960.

#  What Are The Odds Of Getting A Specific 5-Card Poker Hand?

The odds of getting any given poker hand can be computed by determining the probability of drawing each card from a 52-card deck, and multiplying these probabilities together. For example, the odds of drawing a pair of kings from a deck are 4/52, or 1/13.
