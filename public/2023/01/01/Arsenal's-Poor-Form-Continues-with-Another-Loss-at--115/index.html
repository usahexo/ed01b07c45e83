            <h1 id="Arsenal’s-Poor-Form-Continues-with-Another-Loss-at-115"><a href="#Arsenal’s-Poor-Form-Continues-with-Another-Loss-at-115" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal’s Poor Form Continues with Another Loss at -115"></a>Arsenal’s Poor Form Continues with Another Loss at -115</h1><p>Arsenal’s poor form continued over the weekend with a 2-1 loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Gunners are now 5th in the Premier League table, trailing 4th place Spurs by 7 points and 3rd place Liverpool by 12 points.</p>
<p>The Arsenal faithful were hoping for a better performance after back-to-back losses to Manchester City, but they were once again let down by their team. It was a close match until Wolves scored their second goal in the 65th minute, and Arsenal was unable to muster up a comeback.</p>
<p>This latest loss means that Arsenal has only won 2 of its last 9 matches in all competitions. If the Gunners want to make a push for Champions League qualification, they will need to start winning some games soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah continued his impressive scoring form with two goals against Huddersfield Town on Saturday. Salah has now scored 22 goals in 25 Premier League appearances this season, putting him well ahead of his nearest contenders.</p>
<p>Tottenham also picked up a win on Saturday, beating Watford 3-1 at Wembley Stadium. This extended Spurs’ unbeaten run in the Premier League to 8 matches and reduced the gap between them and Liverpool to 5 points.</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-Falls-to-Tottenham-Hotspur-Again-in-Week-10-as-Odds-Favor-Spurs"><a href="#Arsenal-Falls-to-Tottenham-Hotspur-Again-in-Week-10-as-Odds-Favor-Spurs" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal Falls to Tottenham Hotspur Again in Week 10 as Odds Favor Spurs"></a>Arsenal Falls to Tottenham Hotspur Again in Week 10 as Odds Favor Spurs</h1><p>Arsenal’s storied North London Derby history against Tottenham Hotspur took another turn in Week 10 of the Premier League season, as Spurs came away with a 2-1 victory. The Gunners have now lost their last six meetings against their rivals, and odds makers have Tottenham as clear favorites to win the next one as well.</p>
<p>The match was off to a dramatic start, with Arsenal opening the scoring in the fourth minute. Alexandre Lacazette got on the end of an abortive cross from Hector Bellerin, pirouetting to volley home his seventh goal of the season. However, Spurs responded just two minutes later when Christian Eriksen whipped in a free kick that found its way through a crowded penalty area and inside the far post.</p>
<p>Tottenham took control of the match for long stretches after that, with Harry Kane going close on multiple occasions. However, it was Dele Alli who scored what would turn out to be the winning goal in the 83rd minute. The England midfielder collected a pass from Son Heung-min on the edge of the box and lashed a shot into the top corner beyond Petr Cech’s reach.</p>
<p>Arsenal will now look to get back on track when they travel to face Manchester United at Old Trafford in Week 11.</p>
<h1 id="Wenger’s-Side-Struggles-to-Find-Wins-Placed-at-115-for-Future-Matches"><a href="#Wenger’s-Side-Struggles-to-Find-Wins-Placed-at-115-for-Future-Matches" class="headerlink" title="Wenger’s Side Struggles to Find Wins; Placed at -115 for Future Matches"></a>Wenger’s Side Struggles to Find Wins; Placed at -115 for Future Matches</h1><p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger faced heavy criticism this season as his side failed to win a Premier League title for the first time in over a decade. Some report that the club has even placed a 115 million pound bet ensuring Wenger’s departure at the end of the season.</p>
<p>The team started off the season poorly, with back-to-back losses against Liverpool and Stoke City. They then went on to suffer another three-game losing streak in December, which left them in sixth place and 12 points behind leaders Manchester City. January proved to be more successful for the Gunners, as they managed to go unbeaten in all six of their fixtures.</p>
<p>In February, Wenger’s side recorded convincing victories against Everton and Tottenham Hotspur, which helped to increase anticipation levels among fans for the club’s Champions League clash against Bayern Munich. However, Arsenal ultimately suffered a disappointing 10-2 aggregate defeat to the German champions. This resulted in further criticism from pundits and supporters alike, with some calling for Wenger’s resignation.</p>
<p>March was another mixed month for the London club; they won against Hull City but then lost against Watford and Chelsea. Consequently, their position in the Premier League table has remained largely unchanged with just four games remaining. Although they still have an opportunity to finish in second or third place, many observers believe that this season may well be remembered as an unsuccessful one for Wenger and his team.</p>
<h1 id="Gunners-Battle-Hard-but-Lose-to-Manchester-United-115"><a href="#Gunners-Battle-Hard-but-Lose-to-Manchester-United-115" class="headerlink" title="Gunners Battle Hard but Lose to Manchester United -115"></a>Gunners Battle Hard but Lose to Manchester United -115</h1><p>The much anticipated match between Arsenal and Manchester United didn’t produce the results Arsenal fans were hoping for. Going into halftime down 1-0, Arsenal found themselves in a difficult position. The second half was full of excitement and goals, but unfortunately for Arsenal, they conceded three times and lost the match 3-1.</p>
<p>Manchester United got on the scoreboard early with a goal from Romelu Lukaku in the 13th minute. Arsenal tried to respond, but their attacks were mostly unsuccessful. In the second half, things started to look up for the Gunners when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored in the 47th minute. However, Manchester United was not done yet. They answered back with two more goals within minutes of each other to take the lead 3-1. Arsenal continued to try to battle back, but their efforts were not enough in the end.</p>
<p>This loss leaves Arsenal in 6th place in the Premier League table, which is far from ideal as they enter the final stretch of the season. They will need to win their remaining matches and hope that other teams falter if they want to qualify for Champions League next year.</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-FC-Ends-October-with-a-115-Record"><a href="#Arsenal-FC-Ends-October-with-a-115-Record" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal FC Ends October with a -115 Record"></a>Arsenal FC Ends October with a -115 Record</h1><p>Arsenal FC, a club known for their spectacular and electric offense, has had a difficult month. The team has limped to the end of October with a dismal -115 record. This losing streak is the first for Arsenal since 2005, when they posted an abysmal -101 record over the same period.</p>
<p>There is no clear reason for Arsenal’s poor performance this month. Some pundits are blaming the departure of star striker Robin van Persie, who was sold to Manchester United in the offseason. Others claim that new manager Arsène Wenger is not adapting well to changes in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The team’s poor form is most evident in their defense. Arsenal has given up an average of 2 goals per game this month, compared to 1 goal per game last season. This increased vulnerability has cost them dearly, with 5 out of 10 matches ending in defeat.</p>
<p>The only bright spot for Arsenal so far this month is their victory against Queens Park Rangers on October 7th. However, even that win was marred by controversy, as QPR midfielder Joey Barton was sent off for elbowing Jack Wilshere in the face.</p>
<p>Arsenal will have to pull themselves together quickly if they hope to compete for a Champions League spot this season. With Manchester United and Chelsea already far ahead in the standings, Arsenal can no longer afford any more missteps.</p>
