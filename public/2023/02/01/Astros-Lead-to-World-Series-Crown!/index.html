            <h1 id="Astros-Lead-to-World-Series-Crown"><a href="#Astros-Lead-to-World-Series-Crown" class="headerlink" title="Astros Lead to World Series Crown!"></a>Astros Lead to World Series Crown!</h1><p>For the first time in their history, the Houston Astros are World Series champions! Delivering on years of promise, they triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in a thrilling seven-game series.</p>
<p>Offensive MVP George Springer set the tone early with home runs in Games 1 and 4, while ace Justin Verlander was dominant in his two starts. Ex-Dodger Alex Bregman proved to be the X-factor, smashing two crucial home runs in Game 5.</p>
<p>The Astros bullpen was also key, notably Chris Devenski and Brad Peacock who held two come-from-behind victories. Finally, A.J. Hinch’s managerial acumen was on full display as he expertly guided his team to victory.</p>
<p>In a city still recovering from Hurricane Harvey, the Astros provided an essential dose of much-needed joy. And they have now etched their names into the annals of baseball history.</p>
<h1 id="Astros-Up-2-0-In-the-ALDS"><a href="#Astros-Up-2-0-In-the-ALDS" class="headerlink" title="Astros Up 2-0 In the ALDS!"></a>Astros Up 2-0 In the ALDS!</h1><p>Houston has jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the ALDS against the Kansas City Royals. Dallas Keuchel went 6 innings, allowing just 1 run on 5 hits, while striking out 7. The Astros bullpen was lights out, as they combined to pitch 3 scoreless innings. Carlos Correa and Jose Altuve led the offense, with 2 hits apiece.</p>
<p>In Game 2, it was the Houston bullpen that carried the load. Brad Peacock pitched 4 innings of scoreless relief, while Chris Devenski, Ken Giles, and Luke Gregerson all pitched an inning each without giving up a run. Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel hit home runs for the Astros, who now have a chance to sweep the Royals in Game 3 on Monday night.</p>
<h1 id="Correa-Altuve-Power-Astros-Past-Red-Sox"><a href="#Correa-Altuve-Power-Astros-Past-Red-Sox" class="headerlink" title="Correa, Altuve Power Astros Past Red Sox"></a>Correa, Altuve Power Astros Past Red Sox</h1><p>The Houston Astros found themselves in an early hole against the Boston Red Sox. However, they battled back and took the game by a score of 8-2.</p>
<p>The Astros got off to a rough start, as they were down 2-0 before they even had a chance to bat. In the top of the second inning, Xander Bogaerts drove in a run with a single, and then Mookie Betts followed with a home run.</p>
<p>Houston starter Dallas Keuchel was unable to get out of the inning, as he allowed two more runs to score. He was replaced by Brad Peacock, who was able to keep the Red Sox at bay.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the inning, Carlos Correa led off with a home run to cut the deficit to 4-1. José Altuve then doubled and came around to score on a single by Marwin Gonzalez.</p>
<p>The Astros continued to chip away at the lead in the third inning. This time it was Correa again who drove in two runs with a double. Altuve then added an RBI single to make it 7-2 Houston.</p>
<p>Peacock continued to dominate on the mound for Houston, and they added another run in the sixth inning on an RBI single by Altuve. He finished with seven innings pitched, allowing two runs on six hits while striking out nine.</p>
<p>Houston’s bullpen took over from there and closed out the game. Ryan Pressly got the win while Roberto Osuna got his eighth save of the season.</p>
<p>For Boston, Nathan Eovaldi took the loss after giving up seven runs (six earned) in five innings pitched. Bogaerts had three hits while Betts and J.D. Martinez each had two hits apiece.</p>
<h1 id="Springer-Bregman-homer-as-Houston-Astros-top-Seattle-Mariners"><a href="#Springer-Bregman-homer-as-Houston-Astros-top-Seattle-Mariners" class="headerlink" title="Springer, Bregman homer as Houston Astros top Seattle Mariners"></a>Springer, Bregman homer as Houston Astros top Seattle Mariners</h1><p>Lance McCullers Jr. struck out 10 while pitching into the eighth inning, and George Springer and Alex Bregman hit home runs to lead the Houston Astros to a 6-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>McCullers (9-3) allowed two hits and two walks in 7 2&#x2F;3 innings. He has allowed just three earned runs in his past 33 innings.</p>
<p>The Astros have won six of eight to move a season-high 26 games over .500 at 78-52. They also moved a game and a half up on Oakland for the first AL wild card spot.</p>
<p>Seattle lost its fifth in six games and is now seven games back of Houston in the AL West. The Mariners remain 2 1&#x2F;2 games ahead of Boston for the second wild card spot.</p>
<p>Bregman’s 19th homer, a solo shot off Marco Gonzales (13-8) in the fifth inning, gave Houston a 2-0 lead. Springer added his 34th homer, an opposite-field solo shot off Roenis Elias in the seventh inning that extended Houston’s lead to 3-1.</p>
<p>McCullers gave up a leadoff single to Mitch Haniger in the eighth inning and was replaced by Ryan Pressley after striking out Dee Gordon. Haniger advanced to third on Jean Segura’s single before scoring on Nelson Cruz’s sacrifice fly. Pressly got pinch hitter Daniel Vogelbach to ground out to end the inning.</p>
<p>Houston added some insurance with three runs in the ninth inning off Shawn Armstrong. Tyler White had a two-run double and Tony Kemp an RBI single.</p>
<p>Gonzales allowed five hits and two runs in six innings to lose his third straight start.</p>
<h1 id="Houston-Astros-Win-the-AL-West"><a href="#Houston-Astros-Win-the-AL-West" class="headerlink" title="Houston Astros Win the AL West!"></a>Houston Astros Win the AL West!</h1><p>The Houston Astros clinched the AL West division title with an 8-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Sunday. This is their first division championship since 2001 and the fifth in franchise history.</p>
<p>The Astros are now 90-70 on the season and will have home field advantage in the ALDS. They will face either the Cleveland Indians or the Minnesota Twins in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Houston has been one of the best teams in baseball all season long, thanks to a powerful lineup and a strong pitching staff. Jose Altuve has been a stud at the plate, while Justin Verlander, Dallas Keuchel, and Gerrit Cole have been dominant on the mound.</p>
<p>The Astros are poised for a deep playoff run this year. With home field advantage and a loaded roster, they should be considered one of the favorites to win the World Series.</p>
