            <h1 id="Online-Gambling-Industry-Worth-Over-60-Billion-Says-Study"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Industry-Worth-Over-60-Billion-Says-Study" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Industry Worth Over $60 Billion, Says Study"></a>Online Gambling Industry Worth Over $60 Billion, Says Study</h1><p>The global gambling industry is worth over $60 billion and is expected to grow further in the next few years, a study has found.</p>
<p>According to the study by market research firm Technavio, the online gambling segment accounts for over 60% of the total gambling industry. This is because of the increased demand for online casino games, poker, and sports betting.</p>
<p>The online gambling market is growing at a fast pace and is forecast to reach a value of $81.17 billion by 2021, said the report. This will be driven by the increasing penetration of smartphones and other mobile devices, which will give more people access to online gambling content.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the growth of the global tourism industry is also benefiting the online gambling sector. Many people are now traveling to different destinations specifically to place bets on sporting events or play casino games.</p>
<p>Mario Blanco, a lead analyst at Technavio for gaming and lottery, said: “Online gambling operators are offering a wider range of products such as casino games, poker, and sports betting to cater to the needs of different types of players. In addition, they are also using innovative technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to enhance player experience.”</p>
<p>Some regions such as Europe and North America are more developed when it comes to online gambling and account for over two-thirds of the market share. However, emerging markets such as Asia Pacific are expected to witness significant growth in the next few years due to rising disposable incomes and increasing awareness about online gambling opportunities.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gambling-Industry-Continues-to-Boom"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Industry-Continues-to-Boom" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Industry Continues to Boom"></a>Online Gambling Industry Continues to Boom</h1><p>The online gambling industry is booming and is only going to continue to grow in years to come. This is great news for online gamblers as there are now more options than ever before when it comes to where you can gamble. In this article, we will take a look at some of the reasons why the online gambling industry is thriving and why it is only going to get bigger in the years ahead.</p>
<p>The first reason for the growth of online gambling is that it is convenient and easy to access. You can gamble from the comfort of your own home, and you don’t have to leave your house to do so. This is a big draw for many people, as they can enjoy a few rounds of their favourite casino games without having to leave the house.</p>
<p>Another reason for the growth of online gambling is that there are now more options than ever before when it comes to choosing a site to gamble on. You can find sites that cater specifically to your chosen games, or you can find general gambling sites that offer a wide range of games. This gives players plenty of choice when it comes to finding the perfect site for their needs.</p>
<p>In addition, there has been a big increase in mobile gambling in recent years. This is because players can now access their favourite casino games on their smartphones or tablets, which means they can gamble anywhere they go. This has been a major driver of growth in the industry, as more and more people are now being drawn in by the convenience and flexibility of mobile gambling.</p>
<p>The final reason for the growth of online gambling is because it offers players better odds than traditional offline casinos. This is because online casinos have much lower overheads than traditional casinos, meaning they can afford to offer better odds to their players. This has been a major draw for many people who are looking for better value when they gamble.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the reasons why the online gambling industry is booming and why it is only going to get bigger in years to come. If you are looking for a great way to enjoy some excitement and entertainment, then be sure to check out some of the best online casinos today!</p>
<h1 id="The-Online-Gambling-Industry-Is-Booming-and-Only-Getting-Bigger"><a href="#The-Online-Gambling-Industry-Is-Booming-and-Only-Getting-Bigger" class="headerlink" title="The Online Gambling Industry Is Booming and Only Getting Bigger"></a>The Online Gambling Industry Is Booming and Only Getting Bigger</h1><p>The online gambling industry is exploding in popularity, with more and more people turning to the internet to place bets. In 2017, global revenue from gambling hit an all-time high of $445 billion, and the industry is only expected to grow in the years to come.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this surge in online gambling. For one, it’s convenient: you can place bets from anywhere in the world using your laptop or smartphone. Plus, there’s a huge variety of betting options available, from sports betting to casino games to online poker. And thanks to advancements in technology, gambling websites now offer high-quality graphics and realistic sound effects, making the experience even more immersive.</p>
<p>Another reason for the industry’s growth is that regulators are starting to relax their stance on gambling. In many countries, online gambling was once considered taboo, but these attitudes are starting to change as policymakers come to see the benefits of regulating the industry. For example, recent studies have shown that online gambling can help boost tourism and create jobs.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of countries have fully embraced online gambling, but this is likely to change in the coming years. As awareness of the benefits of online gambling grows, we can expect more countries to loosen their restrictions and allow their citizens to gamble legally online. This will create even more opportunities for players and businesses alike and propel the industry even further into the mainstream.</p>
<h1 id="The-Rapid-Growth-of-the-Online-Gambling-Industry-Is-Expected-to-Continue"><a href="#The-Rapid-Growth-of-the-Online-Gambling-Industry-Is-Expected-to-Continue" class="headerlink" title="The Rapid Growth of the Online Gambling Industry Is Expected to Continue"></a>The Rapid Growth of the Online Gambling Industry Is Expected to Continue</h1><p>The online gambling industry is booming, with revenues reaching over $40 billion in 2017. This growth is expected to continue, with revenues reaching nearly $60 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors driving the rapid growth of the online gambling industry. One key factor is the increasing acceptance of gambling, especially among millennials. In addition, there has been an explosion in the number of online casinos and gambling sites in recent years, providing consumers with a wide variety of options.</p>
<p>Another key factor driving growth is the increasing use of mobile devices for gambling. In fact, mobile gambling is now the leading way that people gamble online. This is due to the convenience and ease of using smartphones and tablets to place bets and play games.</p>
<p>Overall, the online gambling industry is experiencing strong growth and is expected to continue doing so in the years ahead. This presents opportunities for both consumers and businesses alike.</p>
<h1 id="Report-Global-Online-Gambling-Revenue-to-Grow-to-81-7-Billion-by-2020"><a href="#Report-Global-Online-Gambling-Revenue-to-Grow-to-81-7-Billion-by-2020" class="headerlink" title="Report: Global Online Gambling Revenue to Grow to $81.7 Billion by 2020"></a>Report: Global Online Gambling Revenue to Grow to $81.7 Billion by 2020</h1><p>The global online gambling market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% from 2016 to 2020, reaching a value of $81.7 billion by 2020, according to a new report by MarketsandMarkets. The report segments the global online gambling market into three categories based on type of gambling activity: sports betting, casino gaming, and poker.</p>
<p>The sports betting segment is expected to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period, followed by casino gaming and poker segments. Geographically, Europe is expected to be the largest online gambling market in 2020; however, Asia-Pacific is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.</p>
<p>Some of the key drivers for this market are the increasing adoption of smartphones and other connected devices, growing internet penetration, and evolving payment technologies. In addition, legalization of online gambling in various countries is also fueling the growth of this market. However, stringent laws and regulations pertaining to online gambling are restraining the growth of this market.</p>
<p>Some of the major players in this market include 888 Holdings Plc (U.K.), Amaya Inc. (Canada), Bwin Interactive Entertainment AG (Austria), Ladbrokes Coral Group plc (U.K.), MGM Resorts International (U.S.), Playtech Plc (U.K.), and William Hill Plc (U.K.).</p>
