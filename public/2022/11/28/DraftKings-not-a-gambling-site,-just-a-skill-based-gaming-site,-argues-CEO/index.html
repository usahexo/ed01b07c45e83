            <h1 id="DraftKings-not-a-gambling-site-just-a-skill-based-gaming-site-argues-CEO"><a href="#DraftKings-not-a-gambling-site-just-a-skill-based-gaming-site-argues-CEO" class="headerlink" title="DraftKings not a gambling site, just a skill-based gaming site, argues CEO"></a>DraftKings not a gambling site, just a skill-based gaming site, argues CEO</h1><p>Boston-based DraftKings is a skill-based gaming site and not a gambling site, according to its CEO, Jason Robins. The company’s defense came in response to New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman,who recently declared that the site is actually a form of gambling and therefore illegal under state law.</p>
<p>In a 26-page letter sent to Schneiderman on Monday, Robins reiterated that the company does not offer games of chance, which is required for an activity to be considered gambling under New York state law. Instead, he argued that DraftKings offers contests that require “substantial skill” in order to win prizes.</p>
<p>Schneiderman isn’t convinced. In a statement released on Monday, he said that the company is “intentionally blurring the lines between games of skill and chance in order to lure people into throwing away their money.”</p>
<p>The dispute between the state’s top prosecutor and DraftKings has been brewing for months. In October, Schneiderman issued a cease-and-desist order to the company, accusing it of violating state gambling laws. But DraftKings fought back, suing Schneiderman in federal court and seeking a declaratory judgment that its activities are legal.</p>
<p>The case is currently pending before U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston. A decision is expected in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="DraftKings-execs-dispute-that-company-is-a-gambling-operation"><a href="#DraftKings-execs-dispute-that-company-is-a-gambling-operation" class="headerlink" title="DraftKings execs dispute that company is a gambling operation"></a>DraftKings execs dispute that company is a gambling operation</h1><p>Executives from DraftKings disputed assertions by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that the company is a gambling operation in testimony before a state senate committee on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Schneiderman has argued that the daily fantasy sports (DFS) industry, of which DraftKings is the largest player, should be subject to the same regulations as casinos and other gambling businesses. He has also called for a temporary halt to DFS operations in New York.</p>
<p>“We think it’s a game of skill,” said DraftKings co-founder and CEO Jason Robins in his testimony. “There’s a lot of data that goes into it. There’s a lot of sophistication that goes into it.”</p>
<p>DraftKings and its chief rival, FanDuel, have come under scrutiny in recent weeks after Schneiderman issued a cease-and-desist order to the companies, claiming they were illegal gambling operations. The order was later overturned by a state Supreme Court justice.</p>
<p>The two companies have continued to operate while the issue makes its way through the courts, but face possible sanctions if they are found to be illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>Attorneys for both companies have maintain that their games are legal because they involve more skill than luck. They argue that players compete against each other rather than against the house, as is typically the case in gambling operations.</p>
<p>State senator John Bonacic, who chairs the committee holding Tuesday’s hearing, said he is open to considering regulation of DFS but wants to make sure any rules are fair for both players and operators.<br>“We don’t want to stifle this industry at its infancy,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-company-DraftKings-says-it’s-not-a-gambling-site"><a href="#Boston-company-DraftKings-says-it’s-not-a-gambling-site" class="headerlink" title="Boston company DraftKings says it’s not a gambling site"></a>Boston company DraftKings says it’s not a gambling site</h1><p>Boston-based company DraftKings says it is not a gambling site, even though people use the site to bet on sporting events.</p>
<p>DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said the company is working with lawmakers in Massachusetts and other states to ensure that its business model is “100 percent compliant” with gambling laws.</p>
<p>“We’re not a gambling site. We’re a sports betting information site,” Robins said Monday on CNBC’s “Squawk Alley.”</p>
<p>The company has come under scrutiny in recent weeks after employees of DraftKings won millions of dollars in entry fees in contests on the site.</p>
<p>Investigators in New York launched an inquiry into whether the company is violating state law by allowing employees to play on the site.</p>
<p>Robins has maintained that the employees did nothing wrong and that they followed all the rules.</p>
<h1 id="Yes-DraftKings-Is-Gambling-Just-Like-Poker"><a href="#Yes-DraftKings-Is-Gambling-Just-Like-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Yes, DraftKings Is Gambling, Just Like Poker"></a>Yes, DraftKings Is Gambling, Just Like Poker</h1><p>Boston-based DraftKings is under scrutiny by some in the state of New York for what they say is an illegal gambling operation. Gambling has been a hot topic issue lately, with lawmakers looking to create more stringent regulations around it.</p>
<p>So what is gambling? The definition can be a little hazy, but generally speaking, gambling refers to any game or activity where money or something of value is risked on the outcome. That could include poker, blackjack, horse racing and yes, daily fantasy sports (DFS).</p>
<p>Some would argue that DFS isn’t gambling because players aren’t risking anything they haven’t already put in their account. But that’s a bit of a semantic argument. The fact is, DFS is dependent on chance just like any other form of gambling. And whether you’re putting up $10 or $10,000, you’re still risking something on the outcome.</p>
<p>Proponents of DFS will tell you that it’s a skill game. And while there may be some element of skill involved, it’s definitely not as cut and dried as say chess or checkers. In fact, a study by David Forrest of the University of Liverpool found that only about 30% of DFS success is attributable to skill factors. The rest is luck.</p>
<p>So does that mean DFS is illegal? Not necessarily. It depends on your state’s laws. In New York, for example, lawmakers are still hashing out how to specifically regulate DFS. A bill was introduced earlier this year that would classify DFS as a game of chance and require operators to obtain licenses from the state gaming commission.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: if your state considers DFS to be gambling, then it’s likely illegal. Check with your local regulating body to find out for sure.</p>
<h1 id="Why-the-Fuss-Over-DraftKings-It’s-Not-Gambling"><a href="#Why-the-Fuss-Over-DraftKings-It’s-Not-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Why the Fuss Over DraftKings? It’s Not Gambling"></a>Why the Fuss Over DraftKings? It’s Not Gambling</h1><p>DraftKings, the $1 billion dollar startup, is under fire from state legislatures and gambling commissions around the country. The main issue: is DraftKings a form of gambling?</p>
<p> determine whether or not the game falls within the definition of gambling ”. The commission found that while there was some element of chance in DraftKings, skill was also a major factor. This week, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission released their findings after an investigation into DraftKings. The goal of the investigation was to„. The commission found that while there was some element of chance in DraftKings, skill was also a major factor.</p>
<p>So what is it that makes this game different from traditional gambling? In order to answer that question, it’s important to first understand how traditional gambling works.</p>
<p>In most forms of gambling, such as casino games or lotteries, there is no skill involved on the part of the player. These games are based purely on luck, so the house always has an edge. This means that over time, the casino will make more money than players lose.</p>
<p>Gambling has been around for centuries and is deeply woven into many cultures. But it’s not just casinos and lotteries that fall under the umbrella of gambling – sports betting does too.</p>
<p>Sports betting is when someone places a wager on the outcome of a sporting event. There is some skill involved in predicting outcomes, but ultimately it comes down to chance which team will win or lose. This is why sports betting is usually regulated by gaming commissions as a form of gambling.</p>
<p>So where does DraftKings fit in? It’s clear that there is some element of chance involved – after all, you are trying to predict which players will perform well on any given day. But like in sports betting, skill is also a major factor. You need to be knowledgeable about different players and teams in order to make good picks.</p>
