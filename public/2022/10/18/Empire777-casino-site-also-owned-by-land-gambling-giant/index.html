            <h1 id="Empire777-casino-site-also-owned-by-land-gambling-giant"><a href="#Empire777-casino-site-also-owned-by-land-gambling-giant" class="headerlink" title="Empire777 casino site also owned by land gambling giant"></a>Empire777 casino site also owned by land gambling giant</h1><p>Only a few months ago, Empire777 casino site was sold by its Maltese owners to international land gambling giant GVC Holdings. The move marks a significant strategic shift by GVC into the online casino market.</p>
<p>The deal has been seen as a coup for GVC, which outbid 888 Holdings and William Hill for the site. Empire777 is considered one of the most successful and popular online casinos in Europe with a player base of over 1 million registered users.</p>
<p>According to analysts, the acquisition of Empire777 gives GVC a strong foothold in the burgeoning Italian and Spanish casino markets, which are among the biggest in Europe. In addition, the purchase provides GVC with an attractive platform for launching new brands into these markets.</p>
<p>GVC has indicated that it plans to invest heavily in marketing and product development at Empire777 to help boost its growth. The company has also announced that it will be winding down operations at two smaller European online casinos that it acquired last year, CasinoClub and SportingBet.</p>
<p>The move is likely to result in job losses at these two sites. In contrast, GVC expects to create around 100 new jobs at Empire777 as it ramps up its marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Empire777 comes at a time when the global online casino market is booming. According to research firm H2 Gaming Capital, the market is expected to grow by more than 20% annually over the next few years to reach $48 billion by 2021.</p>
<h1 id="Empire777-And-Jack-Casino-Sites-Merge"><a href="#Empire777-And-Jack-Casino-Sites-Merge" class="headerlink" title="Empire777 And Jack Casino Sites Merge"></a>Empire777 And Jack Casino Sites Merge</h1><p>The two gambling giants, Empire777 and Jack Casino, have agreed to merge in an effort to create a more formidable player in the online gambling industry.</p>
<p>The merged entity will be known as EmpireJack and will rank among the top five online gambling operators in the world. While both sites offer similar products, the combined company plans to rollout a new sports betting product that will give them a competitive edge over their rivals.</p>
<p>The merger is expected to close in early 2019, pending regulatory approval.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Owns-Empire777-Casino"><a href="#Who-Owns-Empire777-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns Empire777 Casino?"></a>Who Owns Empire777 Casino?</h1><p>The rightful ownership of Empire777 Casino is the subject of much conjecture, but there is little definitive information to be found online. This article seeks to explore the various theories surrounding the casino’s ownership and to provide some clarity as to who may truly be behind it.</p>
<p>One theory suggests that the casino is owned by a trio of businessmen from Israel. This theory is supported by the fact that the casino’s website is registered in Israel and that its software is provided by an Israeli company. However, this theory has not been verified and should be regarded with caution.</p>
<p>Another popular theory claims that Empire777 Casino is owned by a group of Russian businessmen. This theory is based on the fact that many of the casino’s employees are Russian nationals and that its marketing materials make heavy use of Russian symbols and imagery. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>The most plausible theory surrounding Empire777 Casino’s ownership is that it is controlled by a conglomerate of Chinese businesses. This theory is based on several pieces of evidence, including the fact that the casino’s servers are located in China, its customer service phone number leads to a Chinese call center, and its executive team includes several Chinese nationals. In addition, many of the casino’s marketing materials are written in Mandarin Chinese. Although this theory has not been definitively proven, it appears to be the most likely scenario.</p>
<h1 id="Another-Casino-Site-Falls-To-Owner-Of-Jack-Casino"><a href="#Another-Casino-Site-Falls-To-Owner-Of-Jack-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Another Casino Site Falls To Owner Of Jack Casino"></a>Another Casino Site Falls To Owner Of Jack Casino</h1><p>The online casino industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, as more and more people have begun to enjoy the convenience and excitement of gambling from their homes. This growth has not gone unnoticed by criminals, who have increasingly targeted online casinos for theft and fraud. In the latest example, the owner of Jack Casino has shut down a rival site, claiming that it was being used for money laundering.</p>
<p>The closure of the rival site is just the latest in a long string of problems for the online casino industry. In addition to theft and money laundering, online casinos have also been targeted by cybercriminals. Hackers have succeeded in stealing millions of dollars from casino operators, often by breaking into sensitive systems and stealing user information.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many of these security threats can be mitigated with proper security measures. Casinos should take steps to protect their systems from hackers and make sure that they are using up-to-date security software. They should also protect customer information by implementing strong authentication measures and encrypting data transmissions.</p>
<p>In addition, casinos should take steps to ensure their financial stability. They should partner with reputable payment processors and have policies in place to protect against chargebacks. By taking these precautions, casinos can reduce the risk of theft and fraud and ensure that their customers can enjoy a safe and secure online gambling experience.</p>
<h1 id="Empire777-Ownership-Remains-A-Mystery"><a href="#Empire777-Ownership-Remains-A-Mystery" class="headerlink" title="Empire777 Ownership Remains A Mystery"></a>Empire777 Ownership Remains A Mystery</h1><p>Online casino fans were up in arms last week when it was announced that the popular Empire777 casino had been acquired by an unknown party. The new owners have remained tight-lipped about their plans for the casino, leaving players to wonder what the future holds.</p>
<p>Empire777 is a well-known and well-loved online casino, so the news of its acquisition came as a shock to many. Players are eager to find out who the new owners are and what changes they plan to make, but so far they have been tight-lipped. In a statement released last week, the casino said only that they were excited to be working with the new owners and that they planned to continue providing players with the best possible gaming experience.</p>
<p>Some industry insiders have speculated that the new owners may be from outside of the online gaming industry, but nothing has been confirmed. Whatever their background may be, it is clear that the new owners are keeping their cards close to their chest for now.</p>
<p>Players are eagerly awaiting further news about Empire777 and what changes (if any) will be made under new ownership. In the meantime, all we can do is wait and see what happens next.</p>
