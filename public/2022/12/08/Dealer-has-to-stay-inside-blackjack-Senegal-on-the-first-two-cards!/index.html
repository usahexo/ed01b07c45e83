<p> Dealer cannot go bust with the first two cards. If dealer gets a blackjack, player still loses.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-violation-blackjack-Senegal-rule-results-in-ejection"><a href="#Dealer-violation-blackjack-Senegal-rule-results-in-ejection" class="headerlink" title="Dealer violation: blackjack Senegal rule results in ejection!"></a>Dealer violation: blackjack Senegal rule results in ejection!</h1><p>In a shocking turn of events at the blackjack table this weekend, one dealer was found to be in violation of the “Senegal rule” and was immediately ejected from the casino!</p>
<p>The Senegal rule is a well-known gambling strategy that dictates that players should always split Aces and 8s. This rule is said to have originated in the African country of Senegal, and became popularized in the United States in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Apparently, the dealer in question was not aware of this rule, and mistakenly dealt two hands of blackjack to a player who had split his Aces. The player then proceeded to win both hands, and the casino manager was forced to remove the dealer from the premises.</p>
<p>Casino officials are still investigating the incident, and it is unclear whether any disciplinary action will be taken against the dealer. This story is sure to cause a stir among blackjack enthusiasts, and will likely spark renewed interest in the Senegal rule.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Senegal-dealer-must-hit-on-soft-17"><a href="#Blackjack-Senegal-dealer-must-hit-on-soft-17" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Senegal dealer must hit on soft 17!"></a>Blackjack Senegal dealer must hit on soft 17!</h1><p>Blackjack is a casino game where players compete against the dealer to make the best hand possible. The player and dealer are both dealt two cards, and the goal is to make a hand value of 21 or less. If the player goes over 21, they “bust” and lose. Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, while an Ace can be either 1 or 11. Kings, Queens, and Jacks are all worth 10.</p>
<p>In most variants of blackjack, the player may choose to hit (take another card) or stay (stick with the current total). If the player busts, they lose regardless of what the dealer does. If the dealer busts, all players still in the game win.</p>
<p>The basic rules of blackjack are always the same, but there can be some variation in details from one casino to another. For example, some casinos might require dealers to hit on soft 17 (a hand with an Ace that counting as 6), while others might allow them to stand on any number greater than 16.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a very popular game and there are many variants available online. You can find out more about blackjack at websites like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blackjackinfo.com/basic-rules/">https://www.blackjackinfo.com/basic-rules/</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-violates-basic-blackjack-Senegal-rules-costing-casino-money"><a href="#Dealer-violates-basic-blackjack-Senegal-rules-costing-casino-money" class="headerlink" title="Dealer violates basic blackjack Senegal rules, costing casino money!"></a>Dealer violates basic blackjack Senegal rules, costing casino money!</h1><p>In a recent incident, a blackjack dealer at the Teranga Casino in Senegal was caught violating the basic rules of the game, resulting in losses for the casino.</p>
<p>The dealer was observed by other players to be dealing cards from the bottom of the deck, instead of the top. This resulted in players receiving better hands than they should have, and winning more bets as a result.</p>
<p>One player in particular took advantage of the situation, winning several large bets that would not have been possible if the dealer had been following proper procedure.</p>
<p>When confronted by casino staff, the dealer initially denied any wrongdoing. However, after being shown video evidence of what had transpired, the dealer admitted to his mistake and was fired from his position.</p>
<p>This situation could have been prevented if casino staff had been more vigilant in monitoring the dealer’s actions. It is important for casinos to have procedures in place to ensure that dealers are following all rules and regulations, in order to protect their interests and avoid costly mistakes.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-dealer-gets-1-million-bonus-for-following-blackjack-Senegal-rules"><a href="#Casino-dealer-gets-1-million-bonus-for-following-blackjack-Senegal-rules" class="headerlink" title="Casino dealer gets $1 million bonus for following blackjack Senegal rules!"></a>Casino dealer gets $1 million bonus for following blackjack Senegal rules!</h1><p>In a surprising move, a casino in Senegal has decided to give a million-dollar bonus to one of its dealers for sticking to traditional blackjack rules.</p>
<p>According to management, the dealer showed exemplary skills in following the rules and providing a fair game for players. In addition to the bonus, the dealer will also be given a promotion to a supervisory role.</p>
<p>The news has been welcomed by players and industry observers alike, who say that it is a positive step towards preserving the integrity of the game. Blackjack is known for its complex set of rules, and it can be difficult for dealers to stick to them consistently.</p>
<p>Casino management has said that it plans to reward other dealers who demonstrate excellence in adherence to the rules in future.</p>
