In this article, we’re going to take a look at how many possible 5 card poker hands there are.</p>
<p>To start things off, let’s take a look at the five card poker hand rankings:</p>
<p>Royal Flush (A, K, Q, J, 10 all of the same suit)</p>
<p>Straight Flush (five cards in sequence all of the same suit)</p>
<p>Four of a Kind (four cards of the same rank)</p>
<p>Full House (three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank)</p>
<p>Flush (any five cards of the same suit)</p>
<p>Straight (five consecutive cards of any suit)</p>
<p>Three of a Kind (three cards of the same rank)</p>
<p>Two Pair (two different pairs of cards)<br>One Pair (two cards of the same rank)</p>
<p>Now that we know the rankings, let’s take a look at how many possible 5 card poker hands there are in total. </p>
<p>There are exactly 2,598,960 possible 5 card poker hands.</p>
<h1 id="How-Many-Poker-Hands-Can-You-Make-With-5-Cards"><a href="#How-Many-Poker-Hands-Can-You-Make-With-5-Cards" class="headerlink" title="How Many Poker Hands Can You Make With 5 Cards?"></a>How Many Poker Hands Can You Make With 5 Cards?</h1><p>This question is asked frequently, with a wide range of responses. The answer depends on the number of poker hands that can be made from a five-card hand. There are 169 different combinations of five cards. After the first card is dealt, there are still 168 different combinations possible. After the second card is dealt, there are 167 different combinations possible and so on.</p>
<p>There are 10, 2, 1 and 0 royal flushes when using 5 cards. A royal flush is a hand containing an ace, king, queen, jack and ten, all of the same suit. There are also 4 suits in a deck of cards- clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. This means that there are 4*10 or 40 straight flushes. A straight flush is a hand containing five consecutive cards of the same suit. There are 320 four of a kind hands and 1,152 full houses. A full house is a hand containing three of one rank and two of another rank, such as three queens and two jacks. Finally, there are 5,604 pairs when using 5 cards.</p>
<h1 id="How-Many-Different-Poker-Hands-Can-You-Make-With-5-Cards"><a href="#How-Many-Different-Poker-Hands-Can-You-Make-With-5-Cards" class="headerlink" title="How Many Different Poker Hands Can You Make With 5 Cards?"></a>How Many Different Poker Hands Can You Make With 5 Cards?</h1><p>In poker, the number of possible hands you can make is relatively small. With only five cards to work with, there are only 252 possible starting hands. This may seem like a lot, but when you compare it to the number of different hands that can be made with seven cards (2,598,960), it is clear that 5-card poker is much more limited.</p>
<p>Almost all of the 5-card hands can be categorized into one of just thirteen “types” or “classes”. The most common hand is two pair, which accounts for nearly 1 in 4 hands. Here are the thirteen hand classes in order of frequency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two Pair</li>
<li>One Pair</li>
<li>High Card</li>
<li>Three of a Kind</li>
<li>Straight</li>
<li>Flush</li>
<li>Full House</li>
<li>Four of a Kind</li>
<li>Straight Flush </li>
<li>Royal Flush </li>
<li>Five of a Kind </li>
<li>Wild Royal Flush     13. Natural Royal Flush</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-Many-5-Card-Poker-Hands-Are-There"><a href="#How-Many-5-Card-Poker-Hands-Are-There" class="headerlink" title="How Many 5-Card Poker Hands Are There?"></a>How Many 5-Card Poker Hands Are There?</h1><p>There are a total of 2,598,960 5-card poker hands.</p>
<p>To calculate the number of 5-card poker hands, we need to know how many possible hands there are and how many cards are in a deck. The number of possible hands is 52! or 4,320,000. The number of cards in a deck is 52. So, the number of 5-card poker hands is 4,320,000 &#x2F; 52 &#x3D; 2,598,960.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-The-Odds-Of-Getting-A-Specific-5-Card-Poker-Hand"><a href="#What-Are-The-Odds-Of-Getting-A-Specific-5-Card-Poker-Hand" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Odds Of Getting A Specific 5-Card Poker Hand?"></a>What Are The Odds Of Getting A Specific 5-Card Poker Hand?</h1><p>The odds of getting any given poker hand can be computed by determining the probability of drawing each card from a 52-card deck, and multiplying these probabilities together. For example, the odds of drawing a pair of kings from a deck are 4&#x2F;52, or 1&#x2F;13.</p>
<p>The table below shows the odds of getting various types of 5-card poker hands.</p>
<p>Hand Odds Royal Flush 1 in 649,739 Straight Flush 1 in 72,192 Four of a Kind 1 in 4,164 Full House 1 in 693 Flush 1 in 509 Straight 1 in 254 Three of a Kind 1 in 47 Two Pair 1 in 21 One Pair 1 in 13 No Pair (high card) 1 in 2</p>
