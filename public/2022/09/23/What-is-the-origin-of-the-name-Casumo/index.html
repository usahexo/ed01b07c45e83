<h1 id="Who-is-the-owner-of-Casumo"><a href="#Who-is-the-owner-of-Casumo" class="headerlink" title="Who is the owner of Casumo?"></a>Who is the owner of Casumo?</h1><p>Casumo is a privately held company, founded in 2012 by two brothers, Oscar and Casper Slot.</p>
<p>The company started off as an online casino, but has since pivoted to become a more all-encompassing gaming operator.</p>
<p>Today, Casumo employs over 500 people and is one of the fastest growing companies in the Nordics.</p>
<p>The company is headquartered in Malta, with regional offices in Stockholm, London, and Barcelona.</p>
<p>In 2018, Casumo was acquired by Flutter Entertainment plc.</p>
<h1 id="Why-did-Leicester-City-win-the-Premier-League-in-2016"><a href="#Why-did-Leicester-City-win-the-Premier-League-in-2016" class="headerlink" title="Why did Leicester City win the Premier League in 2016?"></a>Why did Leicester City win the Premier League in 2016?</h1><p>Leicester City’s 5,000-1 title success in 2016 was one of the greatest underdog stories in sporting history. But what factors led to their astonishing victory?</p>
<p>The Foxes had been a yo-yo club for most of their history, bouncing between the top two divisions of English football. They had never come close to winning the Premier League title, and were considered relegation fodder by most pundits each season.</p>
<p>However, in the 2015&#x2F;16 campaign Leicester’s players hit new heights, scoring goals for fun and picking up points against the bigger clubs. The likes of Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kanté became household names as they helped Leicester to a shock title win.</p>
<p>So what was behind their remarkable triumph? Here are some of the key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>A strong team ethic</li>
</ol>
<p>Leicester’s players all played for one another, and showed great team spirit throughout the season. This was epitomized by captain Wes Morgan, who led from the front and typified the never-say-die attitude of his teammates.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Claudio Ranieri’s tactics</li>
</ol>
<p>Claudio Ranieri is a master tactician, and he got his team playing some of the best football in the Premier League in 2015&#x2F;16. His use of three centre-backs allowed Leicester to press high up the pitch and strangle opponents defensively.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Good luck with injuries</li>
</ol>
<p>Leicester were remarkably lucky with injuries in 2015&#x2F;16, with only a handful of first-team players missing any significant amount of time. This gave Ranieri enough options to rotate his squad effectively and keep everyone fresh for the run-in.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The “Srivaddhanaprabha effect”</li>
</ol>
<p>Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bankrolled a spending spree prior to the 2015&#x2F;16 season, which helped to improve the quality of the squad. He also created a positive atmosphere at the club, which helped to galvanize the players during their title run.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-Frisch-mean-in-German"><a href="#What-does-Frisch-mean-in-German" class="headerlink" title="What does Frisch mean in German?"></a>What does Frisch mean in German?</h1><p>The word “Frisch” has a few different meanings in the German language. It can mean “fresh” as in new, or it can mean “fresh” as in not spoiled. It can also mean “lively,” “vivacious,” or “energetic.”</p>

It offers a great selection of games and exciting bonuses.</p>
